# MachineLearningYeastProduction
Machine Learnign Project for Cheg 472
Problem Statement:
This project aims to evaluate the production of any genome to evaluate how well their dna analysis and their dna sequencing compares to others.

Input and Output Variables:

Machine Learning Algorithm(s): 

Ethics Considerations:
Graphical User Interface (GUI): If you developed a GUI, provide a link or screenshots demonstrating its functionality.
Dataset: Clearly specify the dataset used, including its source and any preprocessing steps applied.
