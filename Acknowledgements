#This dataset can be leveraged to train machine learning models to predict yeast strain characteristics, optimize fermentation processes, or identify genetic markers related to specific 
phenotypes. By utilizing AI techniques, researchers can gain valuable insights into yeast biology and develop innovative applications in biotechnology and biomedicine.  I did use ai techniques 
for this project I also used datasets from Kaggle and other coding from the cite from the author Debanjan Sarkar with the link, https://www.kaggle.com/code/debanjan2002/yeast-predction/notebook
